<h2>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT starts?
</h2>
<p>My interest in IT started when cloud computing and machine learning had been introduced in the accounting industry about 8 years ago.
Prior to the introduction of these new technologies, accounting work used to involve with the handling of a lot of paperwork. Accountants were generally required to work at office where most of the information were stored offline. In recent years, IT evolution changed the way of accountants conducting their business. Accountants can now work remotely, from anywhere in the world, without being based in the office thanks to the cloud technology. Manual data entries have also been reduced dramatically by the introduction of cloud-based accounting software equipped with machine learning.
These significant improvement in the industry was fascinating and made me interested in learning IT.
</p>
<h2>Was there particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2>
<p>I once attempted to establish a new web application service specialising in accounting and finance field. However, due to the lack of my IT skills and knowledge at that time, the project required great amount of outsourcing which resulted in the increase of project costs. The project could not be carried out at the end due to the shortage of fundings.
This experience encouraged me to learn more about IT skills to proceed with the project without heavily relying on outsourcing of work. Since my first attempt, a long time has passed, and my focus has changed. I no longer have any intention to do a future project for the sole purpose of making profit. Any project I am going to attempt in the future will have an aspect of “hobby”. I feel a sense of achievement when I create something new with my own skills. This is one reason why I want to learn IT skills rather than outsourcing the project.</p>
<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
<p>I was hoping to acquire IT skills & knowledge by obtaining a proper degree, rather than just completing IT training course offered at the other education institutions. I was also looking for a flexibility of learning such as the options of taking remote evening classes – as my daytime would generally be occupied by the busy workload of running my accounting business. RMIT was recommended by Open University, and it met all the requirements I was looking for.
</p>
<h2>What do you expect to learn during studies?</h2>
<p>My aim is to gain skills and knowledge that is required to launch a web application project that I am planning to start after the completion of this course. I also expect to brush up on my fluency in computer programming languages so that I can write codes myself for the front and backend of web application.
