    <h2>Overview
    </h2>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style2.css">
    <p>The project intends to develop a web application which offers a simple portfolio management system and provides financial data for individual users who pursue their financial independence. It will be a membership service with which users become member by entering their personal and financial information in the web application. With the application, members can store and automatically update information about their personal assets and liabilities. The unique proposition with the project is the manipulation of members’ financial information to generate a monthly data analysis report showing demographical and geographical statistics regarding members’ net worth. Financial date will be automatically updated by APIs from various financial institutions. This enables members to visualise and compare their net worth with other members. This feature is important for members to keep track of their progress with their financial goal. Knowing ourselves is the first step toward the success. For example, if our goal is to lose a weight, we need to know how much we weigh now and keep monitoring the progress until achieving the desired outcome. In addition, comparison with the other like-minded people may benefit members to maintain the interest in their personal finance. For example, a member may have a goal to save10 million dollars in 20 years. It seems a daunting task to maintain the motivation for such a long period of time. However, by being able to compare with the others, the member can set up and focus on smaller goals such as getting into the top 10% in 20’s years age group. These smaller steps will ultimately help the member to achieve the bigger goal in the long run.
    </p>
<p>The web application also manipulates the data gathered from members and generate a monthly analysis report for members to read. The report summarises various findings from the members’ data so they can learn from the other members. For example, a member who aims to save 1 million dollars can learn where other members with a million dollars invest their money.
The primary purpose of this IT project is to help ordinary people to be financially successful. For this reason, its focus is to increase number of memberships rather than making a profit. However, it is believed that the introduction of membership fee is possible and my be considered if the project requires a funding to sustain itself.
</p>
    <h2>Motivation
    </h2>
<p>The project idea came from a 1996 book titled <em>The Millionaire Next Door</em> written by Thomas J. Stanley and William D Danko.
The book is based on the extensive research and introduces various statistical information of typical millionaires such as their sex, marital status, occupation, age and education (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire_Next_Door">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire_Next_Door</a> ).
</p>
<p>The sequel of the original book, <em>The Next Millionaire Next Door</em> was published by the daughter of Thomas J. Stanley in 2018. It contains similar information as the original book with more recent data.  In both books, it was concluded that many self-made millionaires did not have a high paid job but obtained the millionaire status by merely being a very good saver. The findings have been an encouragement for many people pursuing financial independent.  Both books have proven with statistical data that the riches are not born but self-made by diligence and hard work.</p>
<p>These books are indeed masterpieces and will continue to motivate the readers. However, in my opinion, there are two issues with these books. Firstly, their statistical information become outdated very quickly. Secondly, it is very time consuming to update the outdated information if we take the traditional way of publishing a book.
</p>
<p>The project idea overcomes the above two issues. What if all information provided in the books are updated automatically and become instantly available with a meaningful and insightful report? The project aims to achieve this.
    </p>
    <h2>Description
    </h2>
    <P>The web application mainly consists of three components, the frontend website, members’ portal, and the backend server/database which contains various data sets extracted from members’ portal. There is an opportunity to later develop iOS and/or android applications for members’ portal page for the better user experience.
</P>
<p>The frontend website takes a role to introduce the service offering and the reason why it is valuable. There is a button in each page to opt in to become a free member. The success of the project highly depends on number of members who participate. More personal information being obtained, more valuable and significant data sets could become for members. Therefore, the founding members will be granted with a free membership for life in return for contributing the project. It is anticipated that the first 5,000 members will be considered the founding members.The above offer will be also detailed in the frontend website.
Once visitors accept the terms and conditions and provide basic personal information, they become members and will gain an access to members’ only portal site.
</p>
<p>Each member will be assigned with their own portal pages. To automate the data feeds, their financial information such as details of bank accounts, superannuation accounts, investment properties, individual shares, other investments, and investment loans need to be provided in the main area of the portal page. Also, A bank feed which is an API to automatically obtain bank transactions from financial institutions should be activated as part of the initial setting.   The idea is to obtain most asset valuations and accounts balances through APIs. If any of financial information is unavailable to be automated, a manual entry is required. Members are encouraged to do the manual input as diligently as possible to obtain more accurate information about their finance.
</p>
<p>Once initial set up is completed, the dashboard is created to show the summary of member’s net worth. Information obtained from the dashboard is easily understood with various charts and graphs. In addition, members can see their rankings for various categories, such as net worth rankings based on the entire member groups, age category, occupation, and local area.
Source data extracted for the ranking system are stored in MySQL which is an open-source database management system. Data contained in the dashboard are automatically fed from the database through the web server to the frontend member’s portal.
</p>
<p>Members can review the up and down of their net worth and rankings to maintain their motivation and continue with their financial journey.
Any member who achieved a milestone (i.e., first million in net worth) may be rewarded on a reward program with a membership discount, gift card or other type of reward. This reward program should also be automated.
</p>
<p>Once the number of members reached 5,000, a monthly data analyst report will begin. As the value of report depends on number of data collected, significant number of members need to participate before generating a meaningful report. With this service, members receive monthly report which contains similar statical information found in <em>The Millionaire Next Doors</em>.
</p>
<p>The example of the report contents are as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>Summary of economic information for the month</li>
  <li>Distribution chart of all members’ net worth</li>
  <li>Number of millionaires out of all members and their typical status including their occupation, age group, marital status, local area, breakdown of their portfolios and other relevant information</li>
  <li>Monthly information about members’ increase and decrease with net worth</li>
  <li>Any new correlation and finding with data</li>
  <li>Any significant change compared with the previous month</li>
</ul>
</P>
<p>Most of the above information is automatically fetched from the database and manipulated to return meaningful information by pre-coded computer programming. The completed report is then distributed to members through automated emailing system.
    </P>
  <h2>Tools and technologies
  </h2>
  <p>The followings are tools and technologies needed to complete the IT project.
  </p>
  <h3>API
  </h3>
  <p>API which stands for Application Programming Interface is an integration technology to enable two applications to interact each other. The technology is essential to automatically feed financial date into the web application (<a href="https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api">https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api</a> ).
  </p>
  <h3>Django
  </h3>
  <p>Django is a template for a computer language, Python which is used for the backend system of the project. Django framework may assist the smooth development of backend application without coding everything from the scratch (<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">https://www.djangoproject.com/</a> ).
  </p>
  <h3>Pandas
  </h3>
  <p>Pandas is a library for Python. Pandas provides open-source tools for data analysis and manipulation. It is required to analyse the data sets and publish meaningful data to the dashboard and monthly reports (<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">https://pandas.pydata.org/</a> ).
  </p>
  <h3>MySQL
  </h3>
  <p>MySQL is a well-known open-source data storage system offered by Oracle. It stores all data sets obtained from members which are the most important asset of the project (<a href="https://www.mysql.com">https://www.mysql.com</a> ).
  </p>
  <h2>Skills Required
  </h2>
  <p>The followings are the skills required for the project.
  </p>
<h3>Skills in frontend computer languages – HTML, CSS and Java Script
</h3>
<p>These computer programming languages need to be mastered to create an attractive and user-friendly frontend website. The website must be welcoming and easy to understand to attract members. Acquiring these skills are possible and can be accomplished within 6 to 12 months from the date of this report.
</p>
<h3>Skills in backend computer languages – Python
</h3>
<p>This is the computer language I am most interested in learning after mastering HTML, CSS and Java Script. There are some opinions that Python is relatively easily learnt and maybe a good option for a beginner like me (<a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/why-python">https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/why-python</a>) . It is anticipated that Python can be mastered in 1 to 2 years. Frameworks and libraries such as Django and Pandas need to be learnt with Python.
</p>
<h3>Skills in the database – MySQL and SQL
</h3>
<P>The project requires a sound knowledge about MySQL as well as SQL, a computer programming language to command MySQL (<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/">https://www.w3schools.com/sql/</a> ). These skills seem the most difficult ones to master as I am completely novice with both the database system and data science.  However, it is feasible if sufficient time is allowed to learn the new skill.
</P>
<h2>Outcome
</h2>
<p>The web application will gather and manipulate significant amount of data sets about personal finance which are timely and ongoing.  It will eliminate the need of conducting intensive research to obtain the required information which is the major improvement from <em>The Millionaire Next Door</em>. These data sets may be reused for academic or the other commercial purposes by third parties. Members can access accurate information about their financial position and compare the result with the others. Members may use the application to motivate themselves to improve their net worth. For the data sets to be meaningful for the users, significant number of members are required. I consider that there should be at least 10,000 members to conclude the project is moderately successful. The membership fee can be gradually introduced to support the further development and generate a potential profit although the monetisation is not the main purpose of this project.
