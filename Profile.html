<h2>What do the results of these tests mean for me?
</h2>
<p>These test results could be a good indication of my state of mind at this point in my life. Overall, the personality results show my introvert and conservative nature. However, it is arguable if these results demonstrate my innate personality and attribute. It is believed that a result could be different depending on my circumstance, age, occupation, and mood. It is considered that my conservative nature was developed through my past events and experience such as being an accountant, a business owner, a husband, and a father. In other words, it is the attribute that I’ve learnt to protect myself and my family. I will use the test results as guidance only as they can change dramatically if my current and future circumstances change.
</p>
<h2>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?
</h2>
<p>These test results may remind me to be more observative and intentional in my dealing with teammates. For example, these test results indicate that I have a tendency not to be very considerable with highly emotional people.  Accordingly, I will try to be more thoughtful in dealing with a teammate who tend to be emotional. In addition, the test results may encourage me to be more proactive with team communication as I tend to be introvert unless I consciously try.
</p>
<h2>How should I take this into account when forming a team?
</h2>
<p>I will be very proactive with finding a team to overcome my introvert nature. In fact, I will be one of the first ones to make a move to find a team. I tend to become very quiet if failed to act at a right opportunity. Accordingly, I will try to be noisy and be proactive from the beginning. The test results indicate that I am not very social person and like to be surrounded by only a few trusted people. I wish I find teammates who I can trust and enjoy working with.
